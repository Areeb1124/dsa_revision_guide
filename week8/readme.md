# 💰 Greedy Algorithms & Heaps

This section is dedicated to **Greedy Algorithms**, a powerful technique for optimization problems, often supercharged by the efficiency of **Heaps**.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- 🧠 The Greedy Choice Property
- 🧱 Optimal Substructure
- ⛰️ Heaps as a Priority Queue Data Structure
- 🔼 Max-Heaps and Min-Heaps
- ⚙️ Core Heap Operations: `push`, `pop`, `top`
- 🤝 Using Heaps to efficiently find the "best" choice at each step

Keep making the best choice at every step! 🚀
